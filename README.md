# streamtrak
Stream audio to icecast directly from Traktor S4, using ffmpeg.

Tested on Traktor S4 MKIII. Prereuisites:
- Define channel C for live input
- Connect chinch from master output to input c on the backside of the S4
- DO NOT press the EXT-button next to the channels gain knob
- Connect mic to the D channel and configre for live input
- press shift-ext to enable mic preamp
- start StreamFromS4
- enjoy

Audio-only works pretty well, while I still have not manged to make the video work.
